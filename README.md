## Introduction📝
This project aims to help individuals estimate their health insurance costs using a machine learning model. The model takes into account various factors such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, and smoking habits to provide an estimate of the insurance premium.🤖🌐

## Dataset 📊
The dataset used for training and testing the model is not included in this repository. However, the model was trained on a dataset that contains relevant features such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, and smoking status, along with corresponding insurance prices.
